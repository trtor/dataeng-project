  TECHNIQUE: In vivo labelling of Tc-99m RBC was performed using intravenous injection of 24.5 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate 20 min following intravenous administration of stannous-containg compound. The imaging of the heart was performed in anterior, LAO45, and LAO70 views in supine position with ECG gating acquisition. The LVEF was analyzed in LAO45 image.

                     The phase images show synchronous contraction of the ventricles.
                      Amplitude and paradox image appears unremarkable.
                     The number of accepted beats is 315 wheares the number of rejected beat is 0 .
                     Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is 63%, which is normal. (Normal >50%) 
  
  IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular function with baseline LVEF of 63%.

    `GATED BLOOD POOL IMAGING (Tc-99m labeled RBC)(The 15th study)                                       
  
  HISTORY: A 62-year-old female, known case of NSCLC is sent to follow up cardiac function 
  
  TECHNIQUE: In vivo labelling of Tc-99m RBC is performed using intravenous injection of 24.0 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate 20 min following intravenous administration of stannous-containg compound. The imaging of the heart is acquired in LAO45, LAO70, and anterior views in supine position 10 minute afterwards with ECG gating acquisition.
  
  COMPARATIVE STUDY: gated blood pool study on 9/02/2021.
  
  FINDINGS: The study reveals normal contraction of the left ventricle without abnormal wall motion.
    The phase images show synchronous contraction of the ventricles.
    Amplitude and paradox image appears unremarkable.
    The accepted beats are 575 beats wheares 8 rejected beats.
    Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is 74%, which is insignificantly changed of LVEF as compared to the previous study ( 74%) .
  
  IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular function with resting LVEF of 74%.

    `GATED BLOOD POOL IMAGING (Tc-99m labeled RBC) The 4th study
  
  HISTORY: A 54-year-old female with breast cancer is sent to follow up cardiac function.
  
  TECHNIQUE: In vivo labelling of Tc-99m RBC is performed using intravenous injection of 17 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate 20 min following intravenous administration of stannous-containing compound. The imaging of the heart is acquired in LAO45, LAO70, and anterior views in supine position 10 min afterwards with ECG gating acquisition.
  
  COMPARISON STUDY: The baseline study on 07/01/2020 and the third study on 20/1/2021.
  
  FINDINGS: The study shows normal contraction of the left ventricle without abnormal regional wall motion.
                      The phase images show synchronous contraction of the left ventricle.
                      Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is 56%, which is not significantly change from previous study (64%) and significantly increased from baseline study (48%).
                       The accepted beats are 601 beats with 12 rejected beats.
  
  IMPRESSION:
  - Normal left ventricular function with resting calculated LVEF of 56%.
  - No significant change of LVEF from previous study but significantly increased from the baseline study
